Photo Sharing Web Application 
-----------------------------

* Taken from Ryan Bigg's "What's Next" guides

This project is about setting up a password-protected photo sharing site.

Photos should only be visible to people who know the password to access the site. Photos should be presented in a 4-column layout to guests using thumbnail versions of the images,
and should be grouped by the month and year in which they were taken, with the photos sorted by their upload time in descending order.
Clicking on a photo should show only that photo, but instead of the thumbnail version it should show the full-size version.

Photos should be uploaded through an admin interface, which is protected by a separate password. It should be possible to upload multiple files at the same time.
